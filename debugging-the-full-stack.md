## 4.0 Debugging The Full-stack of Institutionalised Faults and Errors

Knowledge chooses where it must reside. This set of knowledge has chosen to reside within the current git repository among the many version-controlled hubs of codebases for systems engineering and computer programming designs.

The persistent mechanisms for causing and inflicting continuous injuries, harms, and damages upon targeted innocent civilians has been made so easy within North America that any public service worker who becomes trigger-happy with a computer peripheral, can simply click on a few checkboxes, to initialise state-sponsored instruments for directing forceful actions in an unethical and clandestine manner. Apart from the immediate injuries produced via rapid actions taken by regularised enforcement officers, these types of mechanisms also inflict long term and hidden damages upon chosen victims — by creating a loss of opportunities for gaining dignified work. Such loss occurs when algorithmic background search engines used by potential employers and financial creditors notice the 'red flags' within the victim's digitally recorded profile. Those red flags and other problematic tags are injected into the victim's confidential profile by trained employees of public and private sector entities, specifically to hinder the growth and fruitful prosperity of the segregated target. Tainting confidential and private records of a person or a group of persons in this manner is a discriminatory offense that deserves swift legal actions for preventing and eliminating it through strong punishments and disciplinary actions. 

These types of pernicious activities of a state's or company's hired agents conducted against entire communities remain hidden within the blackboxed environments that are supervised and controlled by accredited authorities. The blackboxed secrecy and hidden nature of such environments and algorithmic mechanisms are typically for the sake of consumer and public good. The overall process of collecting and using people's personal data for immigration, finance, business, healthcare or security purposes is further protected by anonymising and aggregating the data when it is used for driving institutional decision making processes, education, and for creating public policies. But such anonymity is obviously not available at various stages and points of contact with clients or patients who require individualised services by public and private service workers. During such instances, the staff or employee providing the required service or work, needs to have direct and unrestricted access to use and modify the client's data. This is how public service employees and contractors as well as private ones, enter into a fiduciary role with a responsibility and duty of care towards the individual whose data they invariably handle with unfettered access. The misuse and abuse of such a role by members of an institute, agency or a company, and even of a municipality or a state — is a severe breach of trust. Due to such capabilities, responsibility and liability of employed or contracted effectors, it is clear that a debt of restitution is owed to the injured party by the entire organisational unit. And this is mainly because it was the individual organisational unit that had gained people's credence and trust through its outlook and marketing activities that was breached, and also because it was under the purview of the organisational unit where the untoward incidents took place under the supervision of its managerial members and leaders. 

Here it needs to be mentioned that a much worse violation of a person's basic human rights and civil liberties is the dastardly act of causing the person to lose trust in themselves due to the abuse of confidential and private data. A person's trust in themselves can be harmed and damaged because of gaslighting done to the person, or through doubt seeded into the person's conscience about their identity and beliefs via professional psychiatrists and psychologists. And the absolutely worst act of perpetrating a breach of trust is the loathsome act of causing a person to abandon faith in their traditional conception of God or deity, so that the person's belief system can be shattered via torment, physical abuse, electrical shocks, and biochemical torture. Once the captive person's will power and spirit is completely crushed or erased by these types of violent or subversive actions, the hapless individual's perceptions and cultural beliefs are reshaped into a belief system that the state more readily approves of. It is important to note that such actions of torment and torture committed by authorised agents of the state or a sectarian groups are tantamount to genocidal activities of cruelty and crimes against humanity. 

The sets of private data enshrined within public and private institutions or companies, via the design of their fiduciary mechanisms and databases is completely inaccessible for inspection by individual consumers who are often forced to rely on sole government based or privately owned entities handling their confidential data — often due to a physical lack of alternative choices. 

So, when service providers and state-regulated agents mishandle or deliberately spike the personal data within vital records of a person or a group of persons, a methodical and 'well-formed set of procedures' owned and directed via the institute's value networks cause damages by slowly destroying the wronged person's economic opportunities and entitled rights. Such large scale wrongs typically go unnoticed by authorities in charge of creating checks and balances governing those methods and procedures. Worse, while the effects of the harm are evident to the victims, the inability to comprehend and explain how they have come to suffer due to the invisible hand of the market only frustrates and enervates the victims in a continuous manner. At which point, the patronising facetiousness of ill trained psychological healthcare workers and ill equipped social service workers kicks in, to make matters much worse. 

In all of this, the worst and most cruel issue is the abduction of children from targetted parents for forced cultural assimilation, along with the types of bodily harm and sexual exploitation that is inflicted on such poor children within state-run healthcare facilities and 'schools' where they are held against their will. 

**However, the mechanisms for preventing or satisfactorily rectifying any of these types of wrongs don't even exist.**

In many instances, even when irrefutable evidence of such harms and damages are brought forth, which showcase the causal and motivational factors of statutory crimes and professional misconducts of state-sponsored agents, including their modes of operation, the usual tactics of denial and deflection of the evidence are deployed by obtuse offenders. These tactics are typically followed by added offences of illegitimately discrediting, stigmatising, or vilifying the victims. And more often than not, the hard pieces of evidence exposed by the likes of this documentary are rubbished and 'summarily' dismissed by corrupt adjudicators so that the evidence can be forgotten as hearsay. A more disheartening and egregious issue is the cultural practice of vehemently blocking, sidelining, or simply rejecting available evidence to prevent discussions about state-sponsored crimes from even being brought to a public hearing. In this manner, indemnifying, shielding, and protecting wrongdoers by using socio-economic barriers, technical hurdles, and numerous booby traps embedded within judiciary systems against victims and survivors has become _the status quo._  

Hence the inequity and the systematised injustice rages on against ordinary people! It exists and propagates because of engineered designs of its human regulators, and not due to some accidental factors or external forces. 

```
Indeginous and First Nations peoples along with marginalised groups in Canada 
have been truthfully and rightly crying out foul for more than a century, 
but to no avail from a significant and substantial resolution, 
to such long-standing issues and large-scale problems.
```

It is plainly evident and obvious that such deleterious actions of authorised officers and contracted agents at every echelon of Canadian society, have devolved the quality and integrity of Canadian institutes because of the enormous magnitude and incorrigible nature of their deplorable abuses, and due to the ongoing betrayal of credence entrusted to them by susceptible people.  

<b>As a note:</b> The following image and link to its source is an example of the type of commercially available algorithms that are used for sifting through government databases and other confidential corporate records, pertaining to a private individual. These types of algorithms pick up on flags and tags (like simplistic yes/no for a categorical label) within those confidential records and databases. Such flags and labels noted within blackboxed databases are too often devoid of contextual information. When such records are poisoned and spiked by bad actors employed by the state or other corporations, the reports produced by the algorithms automatically and unfairly downgrade the socio-economic opportunities offered via public and private institutes, to the targeted persons or segregated communities. Such socio-economic opportunities are essential and necessary for a person to be able to earn a livelihood, obtain financial loans, have appropriate insurance premiums, and basically have access to a decent quality of life. Once those essential necessities are degraded or robbed through illegitimate profiling, the wronged person suffers silently due to these kinds of pernicious actions. These types of systematically orchestrated 'under the radar' or clandestine actions — cannot be easily identified by the public — as a hazard to civil liberties and as a violation of basic human rights. These types of cunning violations cannot be halted or rectified if they cannot even be noticed or identified by conscientious leaders and systems administrators.
