## 10.0 Insidiousness of Canadian State-Sponsored Violence 

I had gone to a group therapy session in Kitchener, Ontario, in July-2019, that was sponsored by the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA). At that monthly group session meeting, we would always start the session by reading the institute's privacy policy which included the phrase "Trust is of Paramount Importance." At that closed-door and private group therapy session, I happened to mention that I had a folder in my home computer with evidence of war crimes committed by Canadian and US entities. Possessing that evidence and not being able to submit it to the International Criminal Court at the Hague, was weighing heavily on my conscience, because those war crimes included serial mass murder of civilians in Afghanistan, and were committed using engineering designs for drones, stolen from me, via the American military's Office of Naval Research.  

The next day after that group counseling meeting at CMHA, my computer got hacked and only the particular folder in it with evidence of war crimes was tampered with. This indicated to me that Canadian surveillance teams had unlawfully extracted private information spoken during a closed-door meeting from a medical institute, by violating privacy and confidentiality of vulnerable individuals. The breach of trust committed by the Canadian Government via its secret services and clandestine operatives in that incident, was already a serious state-sponsored crime, which then escalated to home invasions committed by them in the months of October-2019 and February-2020. 

Canadian operatives invaded my home when my wife and I weren't in our apartment. Those surreptitious agents ransacked my home and deliberately left their calling card, neatly placed on my pillow in my bedroom, with the insignia of Nabla Kappa Kappa (∇ΚΚ). Their threats advertised to my family and me, in that manner, was perfectly loud and clear. 

The local policing agency called Waterloo Regional Police Services (WRPS) then started harassing me from March-2020, and then they arrested me in May-2020 during Ramadan, using false allegations of me being a mercenary and militant. While those state-sponsored goons were torturing me in a substitute jail, they told me that they wanted to keep me captive on the day of Eid, to see what I would do.  

Those incidents caused the death of a child that my wife and I were planning to have, and subsequently our marriage fell apart. 

In February-2021 I had to escape Canada, on the pains of death, and due to continued harassment from the Canadian Government.

Till date, the Indian Government has not been able to take up this issue with the Canadian Government, of me being violated by Canadian state-sponsored agents who had put me through torment and biochemical torture. And of course, the Canadian Government has been doing a series of systematic criminal activities throughout the previous years against Indians in Canada, by repeatedly instigating violence upon Indians using its incubated factions of the Khalistani Separatist Movement.
