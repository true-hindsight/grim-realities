## 6. Introduction to Special Report 2022-11-11-1

The file named ["protected_file-special_report-2022_11_11-1.pdf.pgp"](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/protected_file-special_report-2022_11_11-1.pdf.pgp) provides details on the liabilities and culpabilities of various Canadian entities that have continued to deliberately harm newcomers, especially international students studying in Canada.

The report is a protected file because it reveals details of named individuals who have been harmed in tragic ways by certain public and private groups in Canada.

Someone downloading and cracking the encryption of those files would be the least of the worries of Canadian officials or a Crown Prosecutor because anyone with those kinds of cybernetics skills and capabilities would also have a much greater set of powers than merely breaking strong encryption. The information those kinds of state-sponsored or private code-breakers could glean from the protected files placed in this repository, would most probably enable them to gain an advantage in defending certain groups they tend to trust implicitly and gravitate towards; or gain an advantage in aggressing against certain groups they tend to distrust implicitly and repel away from.  

I believe it is fair to allow those individuals or groups to compete using their best efforts within a level playing field, where all possible entities can at least download those protected files. How they open and utilise those files to gain information is up to their morale, morals, and sense and sensibilities.

This is merely my way of creating distance and moving further away from each of those entities, in an equidistant manner, in order to stay 'neutral.' Alas, I used to be more friendly with North American entities that had advertised themselves to be reliable and trustworthy, until they defiled my home. Additionally, those entities have continued to destroy the lives of visible minorities out of hatered, and out of their ignorance and discriminatory prejudices. So I am not friends with them anymore. I am not their enemy either, and am as such — neutral — unless they would choose to brand me as an enemy.

Isn't all of the seemingly disparaging text in this repository against various entities, defamatory, and much more angsty than merely being non-cordial? I'd say no. Defamation would be a valid topic of discussion if the evidence of their uncalled for hostilities and continuously increasing levels of aggression against me, my diaspora, and other deliberately targeted groups of people weren't real and veridical. How those hostile entities and their supporters choose to act here onwards is up to them.

I abide by the principal aim of doing no harm to innocent and blameless persons. 

Predatory imperialists and colonialist fiends on the other hand, who have blighted the earth to cater to their insatiable greed, can simply burn due to the smokeless embers of fire that they themselves cunningly proliferated across the world as weapons of mass destruction. 

To swim with sharks one has to be like a shark, or a shark eater. My friends only prefer to be like water.
