## 1.0 Introduction

This work presents a critique and commentary about challenges faced by individuals who have been targeted victims of ongoing nefarious misdeeds and wrongdoings, carried out by coordinated entities incubated within the Canadian public as well as private sectors.

The contents placed here in the public domain firstly highlight the sections of The File that explain the type of hatred and xenophobia baked into Canadian immigration policies and legislature, which happen to be identical to the core tenets of Nazi and white-supremecist idealogies. The comparison of Canadian immigration policies with Nazi literature shows identical ideas and verbiage in both, which substantiates the means by which harm doers usurped instruments of public policy in Canada a long time ago, so that they could aggress against innocent newcomers and refugees in a cunning and surreptitious manner.   

Next, the illegitimacy of the concept of "Justice of The Peace" within Commonwealth Countries is explained. Here we see that the manner in which the bureaucratic treachery enacted via Justices of The Peace against mainly poor, non-white or non-christian groups of people, has been via enforcement actions are along the lines of ethnic cleansing, forced cultural assimilation, and subjugation â€” via government authorised violence, eugenics and racism. The government funded apparatus for passing feckless legal judgements over targeted individuals involves the use of a court employee named Justice of The Peace, who is typically neither a bonafide judge, nor a proper magistrate. A Justice of The Peace is not even an appropriately qualified and vested para-legal aid who has passed any kind of a bar examination. This sly apparatus has been used for promoting and propagating the deleterious Anglo-Saxon Peonage System among Commonwealth Countries, for more than a century.

The intrinsic and inherent racist motivations for doing wilful, forceful and deliberate harm against select groups of people is propagated by various North American agencies tasked with cyberwarfare, intelligence gathering, law enforcement, healthcare, and public services via the connection and coordination among those agencies. Such coordinated harm against innocent people has been and continues to be authorised, approved as well as funded by legislative and judiciary bodies of Canadian federal and provincial governments.

This overall documentation provides an exposition of numerous systemic components and activities of lethally destructive, racist organisations operating within North America that have been shrouded by government-backed secrecy and funding. Such methods and tools adopted by entities of Canadian, British, and American origins have continued to remain hidden behind a dishonourable and disgraceful facade of legal fairness, fair-mindedness, legitimacy, and objectivity. Such mechanisms and operations have been normalised for carrying out disgustingly incorrigible and tortuous deeds by authority figures against snared victims. The good faith and trust invested by unassuming people in fiduciary institutions has thus been betrayed and eroded via guile and deception. This type of large scale, organised criminal behaviour cannot be allowed to continue and go unpunished!


## 1.1 Relevance to human ecology and significance to the international community  

It is important to note that the types of crimes, offences and violations exposed in this documentation have been directed via dastardly motivations, and cunningly coordinated mechanisms, of private as well as state-sponsored entities of Canadian origin. These wrongful deeds have been, and are still being conducted by those entities to produce crippling and murderous effects on numerous targetted groups and individuals. Moreover, these willful crimes have been, and are being committed by state-sponsored entities within, and outside Canadian territorial boundaries. These documented violations and offences include continuous forms of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by Canada that are being perpetrated with the aid of private and government entities from the US and the UK. The substantiating evidence for these claims have been provided in The File.

Therefore, the types of discriminatory and prejudiced crimes, violations and offenses committed by those named entities, which have been ongoing on a daily basis for decades have no expiry date. And **_they cannot be subject to any type of "statutes of limitation"_** under any legitimate framework of justice or ethically worthwhile sense of jurisprudence.

The factors preventing such habitual serial crimes from being subject to any statutes of limitation arise from:
1. their massive magnitude and scale across time and international jurisdictions;
1. the seriously grievous, devastating, sadistic, cunning, and vile nature of the crimes;
1. the fact that the crimes have been primarily motivated by political greed, wickedness, supremecist ideologies, xenophobia, racism, discrimination based on gender and sexual identity, cultural intollerance, and hatred of non-whites and non-christians;
1. the increasingly large number of murdered victims, and suffering survivors, along with their bereaved next of kin;
1. ongoing intergenerational harm;
1. the abject hypocrisy of Canada, Britain, and America in their stance of being globally humanitarian protectors of basic human rights and democracy;
1. the unrepentant and aggravatingly unapologetic attitudes of Canadian, British, and American authorities over the past century that continues to add insult to injury for surviving victims of maimed communities;
1. theft or destruction of land and material resources via such overt and covert crimes;
1. the belligerent, continuous, contiguous as well as unabated form of such violations and offences committed by authoritative figures against innocent and unassuming victims.  

With these appropriately established levels of awareness and the requisite pieces of introductory knowledge, we can now proceed to the subsequent sections of this documentation to excavate the details of the situation at hand.
