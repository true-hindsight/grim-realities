## 7. Styles of Genocides and Remembrance Day

Let's have a look at the differences between the way Russian-led and American-led groups commit genocides.

Within recent news reports publicly available on multimedia channels, acts of genocide by Russian military groups in Ukraine, have been repeatedly showcased with full gusto. Among those reports were images of Russian troops clearing out large areas of land in places like Bucha, Kherson and Mariupol, for mass graves. Subsequent satellite images showed troops burying the dead bodies of Ukrainian civilians, and combat troops, in those mass graves. This was particularly strange to me because Russian rangers usually do *desecrationist* things like leaving dead bodies with hand-carved mutilations, to demoralize returning civilians or troops. The rangers even rig corpses and animal carcasses with explosives, and poisonous boobie-traps, that are left behind deliberately to kill or wound, any aid workers who may eventually try to appropriately dispose of the indecently scattered dead remains. Doing so is a part of the standard protocol and training, of those army rangers. So, it was very strange to see the satellite images of Russian troops giving a proper burial, a proper Christian burial to the killed civilians, within individual graves in a properly prepared graveyard — instead of just dumping all the dead bodies into a pit and walking away. 

The Russians didn't exactly bother to give a standard burial to the mass casualties they generated in Syria, in Chechnya, and in regions that used to be parts of Afghanistan, Armenia, and Georgia. So, it is particularly strange that whichever Russian generals were in-charge of those recent operations in Ukraine, where people were buried in individualized graves, appear to have had some level of decency even while committing a genocide, compared to the Russian military chiefs who had conducted operations in Syria and other regions of the world. 

More recently, grave-sites in and around devastated cities of Ukraine, with mass burials, have been exhumed by returning Ukrainians. Those sites have provided evidence to United Nations' human rights groups, of the numerous persons killed and buried in those graves. The findings indicate that the buried were civilians, including elderly and children. The findings also prove that a number of Ukrainian combat soldiers and militia who were buried in those mass graves, were killed via executions. 

It is entirely strange to me that the Russian military left evidence of their mass executions in Ukraine. Do the Russian soldiers think that the Ukrainians dying in such attacks are their own people? Is that why they decided to bury dead Ukrainians in a civic manner, as though they were burying their own fallen soldiers and civilians? Whether the Russians think that Ukrainians are their own people or not, they have most certainly decided to keep sending their own people as well as others, into ever increasing numbers of mass graves.

My guess is that the Russians know that such properly created burial grounds, wont demoralize the Ukrainians, and will rather embolden Ukrainian civilians and troops — towards vengeance. The Russians appear to be deliberately egging for an extended and bloody war in Eastern Europe, by inciting people towards a cycle of armed conflict and vengeance. 

Now, compared to the genocides of Russian-led armed forces in Ukraine, the genocides of American-led armed forces and groups tend to be more difficult to investigate. American-led entities like to "tie up loose ends," or make it impossible for any human rights observers and advocates, to be able to sift through a burning landfill to find any evidence of war crimes, committed by US-led forces. 

US-led combatants and contractors commit genocides the old-school way, the way the "Holy" Roman Empire did. The "sanctified and approved" methodology used by modern supremacists, for destroying humanity and human ecology, goes somewhat like this: 

1. Destroy and eliminate all census data from the region that is being invaded. Make sure that there can never be any record that indicates how many people used to live in the countries being attacked. 

1. Create massive fire pits near bases in the invaded regions. Use human and all other animal excrement as well as any other flammable materials for fueling the fire pits. 

1. Keep the fire pits burning by constantly supplying tonnes of fecal matter generated by thousands of camped troops. Also dump all hazardous petrochemical, metallic, and fibrous refuse from the base camps, into the fire pits. Especially tires, dump lots and lots of tires, as well as spent and defunct munitions into the massive pits, to keep the fires going.

1. Collect all the civilian and combatant bodies, as well as any body parts left behind from enemy or friendly troops, or from civilians and animals. Dump all of them into the fire pits.

1. Leave no evidence about how native and local people from the invaded regions were killed, using drones and staged shootouts.

1. Ignore harm to friendlies and to encamped troops, from the volatile-cyclic-carbons in the massive plumes that keep emanating from the fires. In fact, tell them that the fire pits are so safe that they can make s'mores over the burning embers.

1. Keep repeating the above set of procedures to completely desecrate and destroy the entire region that is being invaded — to make sure that the numerous fire pits with gigatonnes of hazardous waste materials, remain smoldering or burning for years, after all battles in the region are over, and there is nothing else left to defile.


It can be observed that the difference in the styles of genocides, committed by organizations of different countries, is quite stark. And managing to get any of those genocidal organizations to admit to their faults and errors, is practically impossible, because they usually pull out the card of "sovereign immunity," to deflect any provable evidence of their enormous wrongdoings. 

In the context of the recent genocidal activities committed by various American-led combat units and contractors in the Middle-East: It had taken many months of sustained efforts from countless netizens, and numerous nobodies, to push data about pertinent issues to American talk show host — John Stewart, just so that thousands of harmed and maimed American veterans from recent wars, who were being denied remedies and compensations from their government, could get some measure of restitution. 

But, fire pits created by western allied groups in the Middle-East continue to rage on, only to snuff out the light from those regions with their incorrigibly thick and dark, toxic plumes. There has yet to be a way to even recognize the ongoing ecological devastation, and inter-generational harm, from American led genocides in the Middle-East. These are the international genocides that numerous Canadian troops, intelligence agencies, and contractors have continued to participate in wholeheartedly, aside from actively participating in the ones continuing within Canada and the Americas.  

## 7.1 Remembrance Day

Has Canada ever solemnly commemorated a day to mark and recognize, the poor and innocent civilians who have continued to be murdered, and then indecently thrust into hidden graves, by Canadian forces and religious groups?

Canada celebrates "Remembrance Day" as an ode to its military veterans, and mainly as a form of paying respect to members of Canadian professional cadres who were injured or fallen in combat. The individual as well as collective verve and zeal for Remembrance Day, which blossoms throughout Canada and Britain, is chiefly demonstrated by wearing a symbolic Poppy flower in the month of November, and by publicly displaying slogans such as, "Lest we forget!" 

Such solidarity is quite motivational and inspiring.

But, the evidence of atrocities committed against aboriginal, tribal, indigenous, and First Nations people — as well as the evidence of systematic and murderous violations still being committed by fiduciary officers, including their explicitly verbalized discriminatory motivations against marginalized groups and newcomers — are being surreptitiously covered up, normalized, and whitewashed by Canada's institutionalized practices. This type of insidiousness, dishonors all human beings, and degrades the very concepts of humanity and human rights.

So, will Canada allow for even a single day of commemoration and commiseration, to honor the innocent victims of genocides and organized crimes who were made to suffer or die, due to deliberate actions or neglectfulness, of various recruited personnel forming Canadian cadres and national groups? Does Canada simply not intend to follow through with its publicly venerated principles that are enshrined in documents like the Human Rights Charter? Weren't such publicly espoused charters created in order to produce legitimate, and sustainable positive changes for its peoples and for the international community? Or is Canada afraid that such a day would only remind the world's citizens that its sins against humanity are never to be forgotten, and are yet to be forgiven?    

This is indeed a necessary question to be mindful of, and to meditate upon: 

`"When might Canada's sins against humanity and the world's ecology be forgiven?"`

Well, how can there ever be any scope for forgiveness if there has never been any among the culpable agents and agencies of Canada, that have bothered to formally ask for forgiveness, from any knowable persons regarding Canada's rampant violations against ecological habitats, human rights, and human worth? Those agents and agencies haven't even stopped or curtailed their ongoing genocidal activities; so how can any being expect them to ask for forgiveness, and to then forgive them for their violations and trespasses? 

And why is it that those state-sponsored, as well as privately-sponsored groups of Canada have continued to perpetrate ingloriously overt and covert actions, that continue to inflict immediate as well as pernicious effects upon targeted victims? Is it because those perpetrators are oblivious of their contributions to ongoing genocides? Or is it the case that they are supremely confident, about their so-called unlimited powers, which they deem are above The Ultimate Truth, and can therefore get away with every conceivable deed they have ever committed or will come to enact?

So, dear Canada, shouldn't a similar day like "Remembrance Day" be recognized by an act of legislation that legitimately prevails over Canadian territories, to commemorate and mourn the tragic losses suffered by civilian victims and bereaved survivors of your seemingly never ending genocidal activities? No? Not even, to at least give a pause to those cruel and unworthy activities of your agents and agencies, for merely one day of the year?
